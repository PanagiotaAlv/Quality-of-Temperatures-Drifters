# Quality-of-Temperatures-Drifters

This project provides visualizations for temperature validation and monitoring, by drifters. The script allows plotting of either **Sea Surface Temperature (SST)** or **Ice Surface Temperature (IST)** data, with SST as the default option.

Developed as part of a trainee project at the **Norwegian Meteorological Institute** by **Panagiota Alvanou**.

## Features

- Generate temperature quality plots from NetCDF datasets
- Choose between SST (default) or IST (ice surface temperature)
- Plot data on a global map with Cartopy
- Modular and extendable Python codebase
